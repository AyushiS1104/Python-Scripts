This program works by reading the crawled web pages, 
parsing the text using BeautifulSoup package, 
and tokenising it, creating a list of words. 
It then removes the stopwords using the nltk package. 
Afterword, it creates an index file of all the words 
and their frequencies. It also creates an index with 
the positions of the words within the documents.
